# NZZ Downloader
This is a utility to regularly download today's issue of the [NZZ newspaper](https://www.nzz.ch) in PDF format.

It uses [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to start a Chrome-Browser instance, navigates to 
[https://https://epaper.nzz.ch/storefront/6](https://epaper.nzz.ch/storefront/6) and then 
selects the PDF version to be downloaded (unless that issue is already present in the target folder).

Thus, running this daily will make sure that you have all issues of NZZ downloaded to your destination folder 
in PDF format for your reading pleasure.

## Building the application

Just run the "typical" Maven install, i.e. `mvn clean install` to build the application. The generated run-able .jar can then be found in the project's target subdirectory as `<application>-<version>.jar`

__A remark re. the build process:__

For some reason the generation of an all-in-one .jar (i.e. a .jar-file that includes all application dependencies - which I generate to make it simpler to start and execute the jar instead of having to deal with dozens of additional .jars and their relative paths) first generates a tiny .jar which contains only the application's own class files. The presence of this .jar causes the generation of the all-in-one .jar later in the build to fail. So I added build steps to generate the second .jar under a different name, then to move the first .jar out of the way (by renaming it as `<jar-name>.jar.original`) and then renaming the all-in-one-jar as `<application>-<version>.jar`. If someone knows why the generation of that first .jar happens and has an idea or trick how to skip its generation in the first place, please let me know!
